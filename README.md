# **E-Commerce Payment Model Analysis: Prepaid vs COD**

## **Overview**

This project explores the feasibility and profitability of a prepaid-only payment model compared to the Cash-on-Delivery (COD) model for an e-commerce platform. The focus is on analyzing Return to Origin (RTO) rates, revenue, and profitability to determine the most efficient payment strategy. 

The analysis uses Python for data processing, visualization, and deriving actionable insights. The dataset contains 200 simulated rows of order details, including payment methods, order values, and RTO statuses.

## **Features**

- **Data Analysis**: 
  - Analyze customer behavior based on payment methods.
  - Calculate RTO rates and revenue statistics for prepaid and COD models.
  
- **Profitability Comparison**:
  - Determine the impact of RTO costs on overall profitability for both payment models.
  - Compare Net Revenue to evaluate which model performs better.

- **Visualization**:
  - RTO Rate by Payment Method.
  - Net Revenue Comparison using clear and interactive visualizations.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations.

## **Dataset**

The dataset contains 200 rows with the following columns:

- `Order_ID`: Unique identifier for each order.
- `Payment_Method`: Indicates whether the order was prepaid or COD.
- `Order_Value`: The monetary value of the order.
- `RTO`: A binary indicator (1 for returned orders, 0 for successful delivery).

---

## **Key Insights**

- The RTO rate for COD is significantly higher compared to the prepaid model, resulting in higher operational costs.
- The prepaid model demonstrates greater profitability due to fewer returns, despite potentially higher marketing costs.
